        num_iq_samples (:obj:`int`):
            Since resampling changes the number of points in a tensor, it is necessary to designate how
            many samples should be returned. In the case more samples are produced, the last num_iq_samples of
            the resampled tensor are returned.  In the case les samples are produced, the returned tensor is zero-padded
            to have num_iq_samples.

        keep_samples (:obj:`int`):
            Despite returning a different number of samples being an issue, return however many samples 
            are returned from resample_poly

    Note:
        When rate_ratio is > 1.0, the resampling algorithm produces more samples than the original tensor.
        When rate_ratio < 1.0, the resampling algorithm produces less samples than the original tensor. Hence,
        it is necessary to specify a number of samples to return from the newly resampled tensor so that there are
        always enough samples to return

    Example:
        >>> import torchsig.transforms as ST
        >>> # Randomly resample to a new_rate that is between .75 and 1.5 times the original rate
        >>> transform = ST.RandomResample(lambda: np.random.uniform(.75, 1.5, size=1), num_iq_samples=128)

        >>> transform = ST.RandomResample([1.5, 3.0], num_iq_samples=128)
        >>> # Resample to a new_rate that is always 1.5
