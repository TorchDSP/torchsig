    "\n",
    "* **SignalMetadata**: Object that contains all the metadata for a Signal. There are 7 **core** metadata fields:\n",
    "    * center_freq: Normalized center frequency of signal.\n",
    "    * bandwidth: Normalized bandwidth of signal.\n",
    "    * start_in_samples: Start time of signal in terms of IQ data array idx.\n",
    "    * duration_in_samples: Duration of signal in terms of IQ data array idx.\n",

    "Provide callable transform operations on TorchSig data.\n",
    "* Used with Signal object to modify data\n",
    "* Broad, general application range that include signal processing, communications channel effects, and dataset manipulation\n",
    "* Often configure and call TorchSig Functionals for lower-level operations by controlling how data is modified and defining parameter distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Transforms work at several levels of TorchSig data organization. When applied to Signal objects they transform these isolated signal bursts individually, often to model transmitter effects on signal I/Q data. When applied to Signal objects they transform the aggregate data within these samples, which were constructed with an arbitrary number of Signals. These sample-scale modifications often implement wideband channel or receiver effects, or perform dataset manipulations.\n",

    "Core computational processes and algorithm implementations for transforming data.\n",
    "* Functions that perform fundamental data operations, but do not specify how input parameters are distributed or selected\n",

    "### Dataset Impairments\n",
    "Special collections of Transform sequences that emulate different types of channel environment effects.\n",
    "* Level 0: Perfect environment, such as inside a computer simulation. Has no transforms.\n",
    "* Level 1: Cabled environment, such as a benchtop experiment. Contains some transforms that moderately impair the signals.\n",
    "* Level 2: Wireless environment. Contains many transforms that impair the signals greatly, such as models of radio frequency hardware and wireless channel effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the provided default TorchSig dataset classes allow the user to specify the baseline impairment level, as well as specify any additional desired transforms in sequence. Note that Impairments are carefully applied within the SignalBuilders in a strict order to represent actual signal processing effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata Transforms\n",
    "Similar to Transforms define above, but these transforms do not alter signal data, and only alter signal metadata. \n",
    "* The metadata transforms enable users to calculate custoom labels, targets, or other fields they would like from the dataset. \n",
    "* Metadata transforms interface with SignalMetadata/SignalMetadataExternal.\n",
