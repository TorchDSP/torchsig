All of the IQ time-series within a dataset will always be same, even when there is no signal present, because the underlying noise is created. However, when there is no signal the metadata becomes an empty list. Therefore when viewing the metadata in tensor format there will be zero-padded fields. When processing the output of the data loader the zero-padding will need to be undone."
