    "The Machine Learning (ML) Transforms are a set of data-oriented augmentations and manipulations that TorchSig developers have commonly found to aid with the training of communications signal domain ML models. You might think of these analogously to the randomized augmentations in image rotation, noise, and local region manipulation that often enhance generalization and speed convergence during model training in other domains like computer vision. These are purely data processing transformations that are not meant to represent real world signal effects and conditions. \n",
